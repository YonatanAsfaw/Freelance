    <h2>Artist Bio</h2>
    <p>
      Nathan “BAS” Evans (pronounced bazz) is an African American conceptual artist and philosopher based in Virginia.
      His work confronts the contradictions between faith, identity, and existence — investigating how belief,
      consciousness, and abandonment shape the human condition. Every piece begins on paper, where thought becomes
      physical and reflection turns into form. For Evans, paper is not merely a surface but a witness — the first site
      where language, theology, and psychology collide before finding shape on canvas.

      Guided by inquiry rather than certainty, Evans transforms art into a field of confrontation — a dialogue between
      the divine and the disillusioned. His minimalist compositions and coded symbolism create visual theologies of
      doubt, revelation, and resistance. Through this process, Evans exposes the tension between what we confess and
      what we conceal — between the stories we inherit and the truths we fear to name.

      His artistic mission is to dismantle illusion and awaken awareness. Evans aims to expose the structures that
      preserve spiritual and societal complacency, transforming them into opportunities for revelation. Each work stands
      as both scripture and rebellion — a visual act of faith in the pursuit of unfiltered truth.
